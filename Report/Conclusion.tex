\section{Conclusion}
In this project, our goal is to design a DC to DC converter. Our team has chosen forward converter configuration, \#FOR1, for the project. In this report, we introduced possible topologies and the rationale behind our selection. Then, we theoretically calculated the needs of the project and the components. A detailed component by component calculation has been provided. Moreover, simulations for each component have been done and introduced. With the light of the simulations, our selections and theoretical calculations have been supported. It is now possible to say that the design introduced in this simulation report is doable, and properly functional. In conclusion, EE464 lectures have prepared us academically. We strongly  believe that this project will enhance our understanding, and provide broader vision into power electronics area.
