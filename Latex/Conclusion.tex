\section{Conclusion}

In this report, we have introduced PowerLovers forward converter closed loop design, PCB implementation, and analysis in means of efficiency, thermal durability, and affordability. We included non-ideal simulations with supported analysis and calculations. We strongly believe that this project allowed us to understand more about all the theoretical knowledge we have gained so far. Also, by doing research, we have met advanced information about converters, snubber design, cores, efficiency, switches, stability... It was a great opportunity to work on such a project all together. Apart from the project, it is also essence of power electronics to understand how to design from beginning to the end considering all the relations between the electronics and nature itself. We hold on that we are now more experienced designing converters!
