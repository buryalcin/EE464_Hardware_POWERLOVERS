\section{Introduction}

Static Power Conversion II, a self-defined course, offers numerous isolated and non-isolated converters, inverters and their applications. In Spring'20, the theoretical background that have been acquired is to be turned into a hardware implementation of the combined knowledge all together. However, due to the pandemic, it is not possible to introduce a product but present a detailed design with software supports and PCB design. In this report, forward converter design of group Powerlovers will be introduced. Background information with objectives will take place. Then, all the steps of the projects, tests, design procedures and simulation results will be exhibited. We strongly believe, this project helped us understand the concepts we learnt in the lectures, and we had a chance to see beyond the horizons.
